* 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement (the “License”), Beijing Noitom Technologies Ltd. (“Noitom”) hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, sublicenseable copyright license to use, reproduce, redistribute (subject to restrictions below), modify, and improve the software contained in this Perception Neuron Software Development Kit (“Perception Neuron SDK”), including, but not limited to, the samples, headers, libraries and source. This license is subject to the following terms and conditions:
* 1.1. This license includes the non-exclusive license and right to use (i) the Perception Neuron SDK to make applications, content, games and demos (collectively and generally referred to as “Developer Content”) that run using Perception Neuron hardware and which may incorporate the Perception Neuron SDK in whole or in part in binary or object code; and (ii) to use the Perception Neuron SDK to create derivative works of the Perception Neuron SDK itself (“Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives”), whether in source, binary, or object form, in whole or in part, including third party software unless otherwise noted.
* 1.2. Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives are further defined as source, binary or object code derived exclusively from the Perception Neuron SDK by you; provided, however, that Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives do not include the Developer Content (engines, utilities, applications, content, games or demos) which may be developed using the Perception Neuron SDK. By way of example a game or demo that is developed using the Perception Neuron SDK would not be a Perception Neuron SDK Derivative , nor would a utility or tool set in a pre-existing game engine that is adapted to work with the Perception Neuron SDK be a Perception Neuron SDK Derivative. By way of example, but not limitation, a Perception Neuron SDK Derivative is or would be: either (i) an adaptation of a utility or piece of code from the Perception Neuron SDK to improve efficiency; or(ii) an addition of code or improvement to the Perception Neuron SDK that adds functionality.
* 1.3 For the sake of clarification when you use the Perception Neuron SDK (including Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives) in or with Developer Content, you retain all rights to your Developer Content, and you have no obligations to share or license Developer Content (including your source and object code) to Noitom or any third parties; provided, however, Noitom retains all rights to the Perception Neuron SDK and the Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives that may be incorporated into your Developer Content.
* 2. You, the recipient and user of the Perception Neuron SDK, hereby agree and accept that that Noitom shall own all right, title and interest to the intellectual property rights, including, but limited to copyright, trademark and patent rights, to any Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives that you may create, and you hereby assign any and all such rights to such Perception Neuron SDK Derivatives to Noitom, subject to the following.
